"description":"At LabDAO we believe that open tools accelerate progress. We are a community of scientists and engineers building a global network of laboratories. To give everyone in the world the ability to run wet and dry-lab services from their laptop, we are developing openlab exchange - a peer to peer marketplace protocol for standardized life science APIs. Members of the community pay for laboratory services, mint IP-NFTs, earn governance tokens and use them to vote on funding proposals. LabDAO is building the open source cloud lab for the bio economy: the execution layer for DeSci.",
